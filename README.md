# DB Analyzer

DB Analyzer is a tool for analysing a database so that it can be extracted and archived. It is currently in the prototype stage where it does work, but it is missing a lot of features that would be useful.

## User guide

Refer to [the wiki page](https://github.com/Sydarkivera/DBAnalyzer/wiki) for information on how to run and use the application as well as about how it works.

## Development

Run the project in development by first installing the dependencies with `npm install`

Then you need to start react with `npm run dev:react`
And in another window you start electron with `npm run dev:electron`
